# Log

This is a log of my thought process and workflow.

1. Cloned the project down from Glitch so that I can work with my preferred setup
1. Downloaded the two design images to my iPad for annotating components etc
1. Setup Storybook to develop the components in isolation
1. Setup Prettier, Husky & Lint Staged for automatic code formatting (one less thing to worry about)
