# Farewill React Code Task

## Setup

```bash
yarn install
yarn storybook
yarn start
```

## Thoughts and reasonings behind your decisions

- Prop Types
- Storybook
- React Testing Library
- Prettier, Husky, Lint Staged

## What went well?

- Semantic HTML elements
- Lighthouse and ESLint A11y plugins
- Storybook

## What could have gone better?

- Technical issues with Glitch (shouldn't just exported it to GH and worked there)
- Should've started off by upgrading the dependencies
- Problems getting the tests to run

## Is there anything particular you'd like to come back and improve if you had time? Why?

### General Improvements

These are just some other general considerations for how I'd continue the project if it were an actual product.

- Visual Regression Testing, go for spotting problems with the UX and getting changes reviewed by specific UX team members (e.g. Chromatic)
- Publish Storybook as the design system
- CI (test, build, lint)

## What I've gained from doing the challenge
